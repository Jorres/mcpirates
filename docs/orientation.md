# mcpirates — Claude orientation

NeoForge addon for Create Aeronautics: pirate airships at pillager outposts,
sheriff villager bounty board in villages. See `docs/decisions.md` (authoritative
architecture log) and `docs/design.md` (high-level intent).

## Iterating with the running game

You may launch / restart both the dev server and client yourself via helper script tools/dev_restart.sh.

If necessary you may launch processes directly:

- `./gradlew runServer` — boots the dev server.
- `./gradlew runClientQuick` — boots the dev client AND auto-joins
  `localhost:25565` via `--quickPlayMultiplayer` (see
  `build.gradle:93` — the `clientQuick` run config). Always use this, not
  `runClient` — the test loop skips the title + multiplayer menu, and the
  Claude-bridge MCP needs a player in the world to drive selectors.
- Background both via the Bash `run_in_background` flag; they block until killed.
- `cmd("stop")` over RCON cleanly shuts the server. Wait a few seconds before
  relaunching so the world lock file is released.

**Two hard requirements before testing — DO NOT skip:**

1. **Wipe the world between sessions.** `rm -rf runs/server/world` before each
   test that involves worldgen (outpost / galleon placement, biome filters,
   structure tags). Worldgen-affecting changes (Java structure types, biome
   tags, structure JSONs) only take effect on chunks generated AFTER the
   change — existing chunks were generated under the OLD config. Without a
   wipe you'll get phantom "the change didn't apply" results from stale
   chunks. PRESERVE `runs/server/ops.json` (Dev must stay opped at level 4 —
   see the `feedback_dev_server_ops.md` memory).
   **Exception:** if the user has been _building something_ in the dev world
   recently (a ship in shipyard, a town, hand-placed test scenery they want
   to keep iterating on), do NOT wipe — ask first. The wipe is for
   worldgen-correctness testing, not a default cleanup.
2. **Run the client.** RCON-only "tests" prove the datapack + Java compile,
   not gameplay. Trigger-fired behavior (lift-off, brain ticking, jigsaw
   placement) requires a player in chunks. Missing-client failures will
   mislead you. Always launch `runClientQuick` and wait until `players()`
   lists "Dev" before commanding tests.

Standard restart sequence after a Java/datapack change — **use the script,
don't open-code it**:

1. `cmd("stop")` over RCON (or kill the background `runServer`).
2. `Bash("./tools/dev_restart.sh", run_in_background=true)` — add `--wipe` if
   the change is worldgen-affecting and the user hasn't been building in the
   dev world. The script kills stale client / gradle JVMs, polls the RCON
   port directly (not log lines, which suffer from stale `Dev joined the
game` hits from earlier sessions), launches server, waits for RCON open,
   launches client, and prints `[restart] READY` when done.
3. Wait for Dev to join. The client window takes ~10-30 s to render + join
   after gradle starts it; the script does NOT wait for the player to
   actually connect, only for RCON to come up.
   - **Call `mcp__minecraft__players` first, in the SAME turn as the post-
     READY check.** If "Dev" is listed → proceed. Cost: one tool call.
   - **Don't reach for `ScheduleWakeup` as a first move.** It has a 60-second
     minimum delay — using it before even checking `players()` once burns at
     least a minute of wall-clock when the join probably already happened.
     Schedule a wake-up only if `players()` returned empty AND you have
     nothing else productive to do this turn.
   - **`mcp__minecraft__grep_log` for `Dev joined the game`** is the
     authoritative second-precision signal. Use this if `players()` is empty
     but the timing looks suspicious (maybe Dev joined a moment ago and the
     RCON `list` cache is stale).
   - **Don't fake the wait with shell tricks.** `curl http://localhost:25575`,
     `nc -w 1 localhost 25575`, etc. cannot speak Source RCON (binary protocol
     with handshake/auth) and silently return nothing useful.
4. Then test.

A `minecraft` MCP server is there for this repo. When the
server is running, you can call:

- `cmd(...)` — any server command via RCON
- `tail_log(N)` / `grep_log(regex)` — read latest.log
- `read_block(x,y,z)` / `read_block_path(...)` / `read_entities(selector,path)`
- `locate_structure(name)`, `tp(x,y,z, target=...)`, `players()`
- `setblock`, `fill`, `summon`, `time_set`, `gamemode`

**Read [docs/claude-bridge.md](docs/claude-bridge.md) before using these** —
RCON has no executor (`@s` doesn't work), output is plain text needing parsing,
and there's no live block-scan tool yet. The doc covers selector gotchas,
common patterns, and when to escalate to a Java-side RPC instead.

If RCON tools return `[rcon error: ...]`, the dev server isn't running. Ask the
user to start it.

## Validating changes during iteration

For changes that touch any of:

- `airship/` — assembly, liftoff trigger, brain, kind dispatch
- `pirates/` — crew spawning, captain death
- `PlateauTable`, `HotAirBurners`, `ThrottleLevers`, `ClutchLevers`
- The mixin layer (`mixin/`)

run the gametest suite as the regression check:

```
./gradlew runGameTestServer
```

Cold ~50s, warm ~30s. Runs 12 tests:

- **Buoyancy** — `airshipSmallRisesUnderBuoyancy`, `airshipSmallStabilizesAtFixedTargetHeight`
- **Assembly + actuation** across kinds and rotations — `assemblesAndActuatesOnPursue`,
  `assemblesAndActuatesRotated90`, `assemblesCrossbowBoardKindAndActuates`
- **Rehydrate / defeat** — `rehydrateAtAirpadPicksHover`,
  `rehydrateAwayFromAirpadPicksReturn`, `crewDefeatShutdownDisengagesAndDeregisters`,
  `rehydrateSkipsDefeatedShip`, `multiShipRehydrate`

All tests are sequential (each in its own batch), isolated (arenas ~200
blocks apart via `StructureGridSpawnerMixin`), and the gametest world is
wiped before every run via `build.gradle`'s `doFirst` hook — no state leaks
between runs.

Failing tests print to console with a `LogTestReporter` line; the per-tick
state of each ship is in `runs/gametest/logs/latest.log`.

The full dev-server loop (`runServer` + `runClientQuick`) remains the right
choice for behaviour the gametest suite doesn't cover (worldgen, the
proximity-trigger event path with a real `ServerPlayer`, anything visual). Use
both — gametest for fast regression, dev-server for end-to-end. **A change
that compiles is not validated until at least one of the two has been run.**

## Hard constraints

- **Working dir:** `mcpirates/`. The parent `aero/` is the user's live
  `.minecraft`. Never write outside `mcpirates/`.
- **Pinned versions:** see `gradle.properties`. NeoForge **21.1.228**,
  Lithostitched **1.7.0**
